## The Mission

You are a data analysis consultant at a big company that has just migrated their data to a **SQL DB**. Your mission is to help the company find business insights from the data that will help their grow their business.

They provide you this [SQL DB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1db7Lc3vbLwOCflAnhycTR0C5AwWJWOMo/view?usp=sharing).

It consists of a database of all the active companies in Belgium and it contains information about their address, contact details, activities, establishments... Note that those data are coming from [public open data](https://economie.fgov.be/en/themes/enterprises/crossroads-bank-enterprises/services-everyone/public-data-available-reuse/cbe-open-data)

Download it and connect it to a visualization tool (e.g. Streamlit) with [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).

To do so, you will create you first dashboard! What is important to include in the dashboard? That is part of your mission! Make sure to communicate and ask questions to the client as you build your solution. 


### Must-have features

- Connect a SQL Database to a visualization tool (e.g. Streamlit or Plotly).
- Create a dashboard that showcases business insights for the client.
- Present your findings in a short presentation (7 minutes) to the client.
-  You answer to those questions:
    - Which percentage of the companies are under which juridical form?
    - Which percentage of the companies are under which Status?
    - Which percentage of the companies are which type of entreprise?
    - What is the average company's age in each sector *(hint: look what is the NACE code)*?
- You also add some revelent inside to the dashboard. Be creative!
